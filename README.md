# COMP_472_AI_Project
AI projet for the Course COMP 472. The game is Hungry Brids, full project description provided in the repo (Look for COMP 472 Project Guidelines).

The AI used follows the MiniMax algorithm.

As the project is currently still in the early stages, further information about the operation is not available. 
Only the "Human vs Human" game ode is available.

Given this is an academic project, to avoid plagerism and other realted charges, the project will only be updated after each submission.
